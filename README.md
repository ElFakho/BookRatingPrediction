# Book Rating Prediction Project

This project develops a machine learning model to predict book ratings, aimed at publishers, authors, and readers interested. Using data analysis and model comparison, it identifies the most effective predictors of ratings, offering insights for improving book marketing and selection strategies.




## Features and Dataset

The dataset includes the following key features:

- Title
- Authors
- Average Ratings
- Language Code
- Number of Pages
- Ratings Count
- Text Reviews Count
- Publication Date
- Publisher
Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were implemented to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis.


## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Numpy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models


## Models Evaluated

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Lasso Regression
Random Forest demonstrated the best performance based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), indicating its effectiveness in handling the dataset's complexities.


## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- plotly
- scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly scikit-learn
```
    
## Run Locally

To explore this book ratings prediction project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
- First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ElFakho/BookRatingPrediction
```
- This command downloads the project files to your computer.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
- Change into the project directory with:

```bash
  cd BookRatingPrediction
```

3. Use the Cleaned Data
- The repository includes a cleaned version of the `books.csv file` which has been pre-processed directly in Excel to correct certain data inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook
- Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
  pip install notebook
```
- Start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
  jupyter notebook
```
- This command will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

5. Open the Notebook
- In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the `ProjetML.ipynb` notebook. Open it by clicking on the file name.

6. Execute the Notebook

By following these steps, you'll be able to review the complete analysis, from data cleaning to model evaluation, using the pre-processed `books.csv` data file included in the repository.
